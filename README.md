## Architecture Overview
Backend (for Admin and Client Data) - Spring Boot RESTful Service, PostgreSQL persistent data storage

Client (Admin) - Vue.js

Client (Companion App) - Native iOS application, written in Swift.

 - Both the frontend and backend components have some foundation but are not complete.
 - Authentication on the backend using JWT Token is incomplete but has a start.
 - Backend data storage is beginning to persist but has some bugs needing worked out.
 - Frontend needs designed, but RESTful APIs should make hooking up the data simple once all endpoint are laid out.
