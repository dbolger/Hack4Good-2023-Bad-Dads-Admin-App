# Bad Dads
Dylan Bolger



Both the frontend and backend components have some foundation but are not complete.
Authentication on the backend using JWT Token is incomplete but has a start.
Backend data storage is beginning to persist but has some bugs needing worked out.
Frontend needs designed, but RESTful APIs should make hooking up the data simple once all endpoint are laid out.
